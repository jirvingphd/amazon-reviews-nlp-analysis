I guess that's to be expected with a product that is 100% fiber and 0 calories; but it's just so off-putting. They really do absorb the taste of whatever you cook them in, but they feel like tiny bits of rubber in your mouth. I've tried the noodles too, and they were slightly better. I really hope someone comes up with a way to make this stuff more palatable. Maybe it could be used it make fake tapioca pudding?\\nPlus, when you open the package, it smells like old fish.\"\n",

It isn't solid feeling like a noodle and the odor is too much.

Lots of people seem to eat it just fine, but take precautions.\"\n",

My teenage daughter even liked them. Quick and easy to heat as well. The rice is more in texture and shape like a cuscus, but still tasted good as fried rice. I will be getting more of them.'\n",

I read online that they may smell like fish.  (I do not/will not eat sea food).  But they did not smell at all.  I held my breath just in case but still no smell after rinsing.\\nI decided to try this brand since it was 0 calorie.  I did the same thing and held my breath, started rinsing than breathed again and I about lost it with the disgusting extremely fishy smell through my whole kitchen!  The smell did not totally go away after rinsing for 3 minutes straight under running water.  When I boiled them, the steam stunk too.  I managed to still eat them after covering them in spaghetti meat sauce.  But I won't buy again.  I couldn't get past the smell.  I'll stick to the to 15 calories/serving brand!\"\n",

I make a soup in bulk with ground turkey or chopped chicken breast, lots of veggies, soy sauce and broth and pack it for my lunch each day.  Healthy bulk with no calories.  One thing -- don't freeze it.  Add it fresh.  I froze my soup with MiraclNoodles in it once, and the noodles became like strings of plastic wrap in my soup.  Yuk.

They are not exactly the same as flour/egg noodles, so don\\'t expect that. But I would say they\\'re a 10/10 substitute for rice noodles. I used the \"rice\" in stir-fry and it was pretty good- not amazing, but pretty good. The rice was comparable to tapioca beads, and I think honestly would be really nice in a pudding dessert minus some of the carbs :)\\nI plan on using the noodles in some thick spaghetti sauce with ground beef soon, and making some kind of pho.

They absorb flavor well, but take a little time to prepare as you have to rinse them and heat them up to dry them out. They're better used as noodles (like in Asian dishes) than as a pasta substitute. I put the rice noodles in beef stew and they held up well reheating leftovers.\",\n",

       "       b\"Fantastic noodles!: I'm eating a bowl of these as I write this review; I just couldn't wait to talk about them!\\n\\nI ordered these (after seeing them on Cooking With Dog) in the hopes that I could increase my fiber intake, and the zero calorie thing came as an added bonus. I was really nervous to make these because of some of the negative reviews, but I genuinely feel that those particular reviewers were either 1) expecting something that tasted exactly like pasta, or 2) did not prepare these correctly. Prep is absolutely essential.\\n\\nFirst off, the fishy smell reminds me of a fresh fish market, and was not at all unpleasant. That smell (as others have said) does not carry over into the flavor. You need to rinse these for about 4-5 minutes in cold water until the smell goes away, and then drop them into a pot of boiling water for 5-6 minutes. Strain them, rinse again in cold water (to remove the rubbery texture they get when boiled) and finally dry saute them in a pan till you hear squeaking. It's a little time consuming, but nothing crazy.\\n\\nI soaked the prepared noodles for a few hours in my favorite sauce (hoisin, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and water to thin it out) and combined it with pan fried tofu. The texture of the noodles is perfect -not starchy or rubbery, but sort of lightly chewy yet still soft enough to bite through cleanly, as most asain noodles are- and they soaked up the sauce and taste absolutely fabulous!\\n\\nIt may be a bit pricey for everyday fare, but for a health conscious college student like me, it's enough to take the edge off of takeout cravings. Give these a shot!\",\n",

       "       b\"Make sure you know how to prepare this specific noodle!: If you know how to prepare the product, it can taste just like normal noodles.\\n\\nI love the invention of shirataki noodles. If you're like me, indulging in noodle-based meals can be too easy.\\n\\nWith this product, you're free and able to stuff your face with pasta and noodles.\",\n",
       "       b\"I was disappointed because the noodles arrived floating in bags of water: I was disappointed because the noodles arrived floating in bags of water. According to the enclosed instructions you had to rinse them and dehydrate them in a pan before you could use them as noodles. I haven't had time to finish processing them so I don't know what they taste like.\",\n",
       "       b'Not too bad!: I ordered these with some trepidation, but after preparing exactly as directed on the package, I find them a wonderful addition to spicy Thai coconut chicken soup - basically, a substitute for glass noodles.  I also keep them around the house to combine with pasta sauce when I feel like a super-quick, almost calorie-free bowl of noodles. Definitely better the 2nd day.',\n",
       "       b'Five Stars: These are awesome if you follow the directions no calories no carbs',\n",

       "       b'Meh! Disappointing..............Tastes NOTHING Like Real Rice!!!: When I decided to buy this&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;I did so, after having bought the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta&nbsp;and ABSOLUTELY LOVING it. Because I am on a&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, which prohibits the consumption of wheat & any product made with wheat (pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and I LOVE pasta & noodles, which are my favorite food after sushi, steak & shellfish, I was so glad to find the Miracle Noodle angel hair and fettucine pasta.\\n\\nHowever, even though&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;is primarily a wheat-free diet, because its also supposed to be low-carb & grain-free, other non-wheat grains & starchy carbs like rice, potatoes and corn are discouraged (or at least advised to only consume in very limited amounts as rarely as possible)\\n\\nUnfortunately I LOVE basmati rice -- especially when having it with the \"Morey\\'s Seafood\" brand of \"Seasoned Grill Wild-Caught Alaskan Salmon\" which I get from the frozen food section at Costco (and prior to that, at Sam\\'s Club) and ever since I started the&nbsp;Wheat Belly&nbsp;diet, I was missing having rice so much that I mostly stopped eating the Morey\\'s Seafood Seasoned Grill Salmon, because it just wasn\\'t the same without the fluffy & buttery basmati rice to enjoy it with.\\n\\nThen I happened to see a listing for this Miracle Noodle Rice while ordering the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Angel Hair Pasta&nbsp;and I knew I just HAD to try it.\\n\\nNow before going any further, I just wanted to clarify that when I ordered this&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;I had NO illusions whatsoever that this would taste like basmati rice, in any way! Even before I ordered this, I knew it would be difficult if not impossible to replicate the taste & texture of basmati rice into a no-carb calorie free version. So despite the name of the brand, I was NOT expecting a miracle. However, while I knew that it would probably not taste like basmati rice -- I was hoping that it would at least taste like SOME kind of rice.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I was wrong! Not only does it not LOOK like rice but it also does NOT taste like ANY kind of rice either!\\n\\nThis so-called \"rice\" is a bunch of tiny white little balls, that kind of look like caviar (though I\\'ve never had caviar, this looks like a white version of it!) or tapioca. In fact, when I made this for a close friend, one of the first things she said, when she saw it was that it looked and tasted like \"sabudana\" (which is what tapioca is called in many of the languages in India).\\n\\nAs for the taste,&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Rice&nbsp;does NOT taste even remotely like rice! Not only that but this \"rice\" doesn\\'t even taste much different than any of the other varieties of Miracle Noodle pastas -- and as a matter of fact, it tastes more like an orzo pasta than rice, and I don\\'t know on what planet this could in any way be considered \"rice\"!\\n\\nEven though I followed all the directions, and experimented with these in many different kinds of recipes, NOTHING I tried made it taste even REMOTELY like rice -- and it would have been better if they had just labeled this as an orzo pasta or something instead. At least then, that would be more accurate and honest. Becasue calling this item \"rice\" is VERY misleading and a HUGE disappointment!\\n\\nWhich is why, although I LOVE the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Angel Hair&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Miracle Noodle Pasta, Fetuccine, I will probably never be buying this so-called \"rice\" again!'],\n",
