    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on preparing a subset of Amazon reviews for the Home and Kitchen category. This involves several data preprocessing steps to ensure that the data is clean, relevant, and ready for detailed analysis. The main goals of this notebook are to filter and clean the data, combine reviews with metadata, and save the final subsets for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Combine Data**:\n",
    "   - Efficiently load the raw review files and metadata for the Home and Kitchen category.\n",
    "   - Combine the review and metadata files to create a unified dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Filter the metadata to retain only relevant products.\n",
    "   - Apply one-hot encoding to the categorical data.\n",
    "   - Remove non-essential features to streamline the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Meaningful Subsets**:\n",
    "   - Identify products with sufficient review data for detailed analysis.\n",
    "   - Group reviews by product, category, and other relevant features to focus the analysis on key items.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the Final Subsets**:\n",
    "   - Save the cleaned and filtered subsets of reviews and metadata for use in subsequent analysis steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have a well-structured subset of Amazon reviews for the Home and Kitchen category, ready for in-depth analysis to extract valuable insights into customer preferences and sentiments.\n"
