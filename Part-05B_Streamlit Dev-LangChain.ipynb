    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on developing a Streamlit application that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to provide interactive and dynamic visualizations and functionalities. By integrating LangChain and other NLP tools, we aim to create an engaging and informative user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare LLM-Related Elements**:\n",
    "   - Load and preprocess the review and metadata for use within the Streamlit app.\n",
    "   - Summarize reviews using pretrained models to provide concise insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement ChatGPT Integration**:\n",
    "   - Use LangChain’s `ChatOpenAI` to generate responses based on user queries.\n",
    "   - Create custom prompts to perform specific tasks such as summarizing feedback or providing recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Vector Database**:\n",
    "   - Split review texts into manageable chunks and embed them using OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "   - Store and retrieve document embeddings to perform similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Develop the Streamlit Application**:\n",
    "   - Design and implement interactive components and visualizations to display review summaries, sentiment scores, and topic models.\n",
    "   - Provide search and retrieval functionalities to answer user queries about the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have a fully functional Streamlit application that allows users to interactively explore and analyze Amazon reviews, gaining valuable insights into customer preferences and sentiments.\n"
